this "intelighome" project is made by "medricho" who live in Alborz iran 
this is project of arduino and app inventor, and made by me to controll the home elements connected to arduino

   <h3> guide : </h3>
  <p >
first of all install the apk file into your android phone *(ios will come soon...)
then make sure you connected the arduino like the photograph (sketch) i uploaded 
and connect the arduino uno to your PC 
now you can turn on your Phone's Blutooth and connect to the HC05 with 1234 password 
so open app and controll the home :)
